      "text": "Introduction to the 6502 Microprocessor\n\n Overview\n\nThe 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s. It powered computers like the Apple II, Atari 2600, and the Commodore 64.\n\n Key Characteristics\n\nThe 6502 has a simple yet powerful instruction set with just 56 basic instructions. It uses a single accumulator for arithmetic operations and has two index registers X and Y for memory addressing.\n\n Registers\n\n- Accumulator A: Main register for arithmetic and logic operations\n- Index Register X: Used for indexed addressing modes\n- Index Register Y: Used for indexed addressing modes\n- Program Counter PC: 16-bit register pointing to the next instruction\n- Stack Pointer SP: Points to the top of the stack in page 1 memory\n- Status Register P: Contains processor flags\n\n Memory Organization\n\nThe 6502 uses 16-bit addresses, allowing access to 64KB of memory. The memory is typically organized as follows:",

The memory is typically organized as follows:\n\n- $0000-$00FF: Zero Page 256 bytes, fast access\n- $0100-$01FF: Stack 256 bytes\n- $0200-$FFFF: Main program memory\n\n Addressing Modes\n\nThe 6502 supports several addressing modes:\n\n1. Implied: No operand required\n2. Accumulator: Operation on the accumulator\n3. Immediate: 8-bit constant value\n4. Zero Page: 8-bit address in zero page\n5. Zero Page, X: Zero page address + X index\n6. Zero Page, Y: Zero page address + Y index\n7. Absolute: 16-bit address\n8. Absolute, X: Absolute address + X index\n9. Absolute, Y: Absolute address + Y index\n10. Indirect: Pointer-based addressing\n11. Indexed Indirect: Combines indexing and indirect addressing\n12. Indirect Indexed: Indirect addressing with Y indexing\n13. Relative: For branch instructions\n\n Common Instructions",

Its clean instruction set and efficient addressing modes made it popular for embedded systems and game consoles. Understanding the 6502 provides valuable insights into microprocessor design and low-level programming.",
